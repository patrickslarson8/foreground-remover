## Overview

This is an implementation of Mediapipe that reverses the background mask to make it a foreground mask. There is some implementation with pygui to provide foreground image selection and masking properties.

This project was created as a halloween virtual costume, to make someone appear as a ghost in a Teams/Zoom type meeting.

### TODO

1. Tie in mediapipe mask to preview embedded in window
2. Provide appropriate references to code used
3. Create virtual camera output for piping into other programs
